How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Comparing the two files helps to find the difference

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Then i can compare different vesions and choose the better version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Because it is manually we have full control when to save our works
    But we might make a wrong call and save at the wrong time

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    all the files of the program should be saved together

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    obtain the commit id using git log and check using git diff

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    you can always go back to the previous working code

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
